### First time Set-up
After making sure that all the above-mentioned requirements are satisfied the game is easy to run in just 2 simple steps.

1) Open a terminal at the root of the project and use the Makefile to create an executable.

        make all

2) Run the newly created executable (Asteroids) from the project root.

Enjoy playing the game using executable moving on!

## The Implementation
Implementation wise, we have chosen to develop the game in C. This is due to the fact that it is a language we are all familiar with and it is relatively low-level. 
A low-level language was the appropriate method for the project because we wanted to implement the game for use on an oscilloscope, which was made much more feasible with this approach.. 
We developed the game in a Linux environment. <p>For more information regarding the development in Linux, see the <strong>Installation Guide</strong> above. For more information or troubleshooting see the software manual or contact us.

## Ackowledgement
We would like to deeply thank our project supervisor Professor Graham Hutton, our Software Engineering Group Project module convenor Professor Geert De Maere for all of their support and guidance in making this project fruitful and enjoyable, and the University of Nottingham along with the School of Computer Science which gave us the opportunity to work on the project.

"I would also like to congratulate and thank our team for the amount of work we all have contributed towards making this a success. Every hurdle along the way was made easier when we discussed it as a team. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be your Team Leader and I look forward to working with you all again!"
