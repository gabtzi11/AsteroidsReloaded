### First time Set-up
After making sure that all the above-mentioned requirements are satisfied the game is easy to run in just 2 simple steps.

1) Open a terminal at the root of the project and use the Makefile to create an executable.

        make all

2) Run the newly created executable (Asteroids) from the project root.

Enjoy playing the game using executable moving on!

## The Implementation
Implementation wise, we have chosen to develop the game in C. This is due to the fact that it is a language we are all familiar with and it is relatively low-level. 
A low-level language was the appropriate method for the project because we wanted to implement the game for use on an oscilloscope, which was made much more feasible with this approach.. 
We developed the game in a Linux environment. <p>For more information regarding the development in Linux, see the <strong>Installation Guide</strong> above. For more information or troubleshooting see the software manual or contact us.
